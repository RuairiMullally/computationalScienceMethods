% PART 3: Calculate ratio between calculations using "for loops" or "vector operations"
%
% Calculate speed difference by repeating this 2xxxx times, record operation time using tic-toc function.
% If you do something once in a computer, its going to be too fast to measure differences 
% So we are going to do the calculation with "for loops" and then "vector operations" 2000 times each
%   which will result in measurable times.
%
% First Calculate power output for all r_vals using a single vector operation to give power_output_a
M = 2000;  %This is the variable name for the number of times you want to do the operation

tstart = tic; % This starts the clock in Matlab and puts the stoipwatch starttime in tstart
for n = 1 : M  % This is the loop for calculating the power_output_a "M"
   power_output_a = (rho*pi*(r_vals.^2)*(v^3))/2;  %Tis is where you have to fill in your vector calculation for power
end
T_v = toc(tstart); % Here you have to figure out how to get the current stopwatch time and calculate the average time for execution of one calculation T_v. See[6]

% Calculate power output using "for" loops, to yield the vector power_output_f
power_output_f = zeros(); % This is the variable we are using to store the output 
tstart = tic; % As above we have to start the stopwatch
for n = 1 : M  %Again we are doing this 2000 times
    for i = 1 : length(r_vals)
        power_output_f(i) = (rho*pi*(r_vals(i)^2)*(v^3))/2;
    end
    % Now in here goes the calculation of the power output for each value in r_val, and you are going to use a "for" loop to do that
end
T_f = toc(tstart); %And now read the stopwatch and measure the time for execution of one calculation  T_f

% Compute time ratio. This should be a nunmber bigger than 1 because "for" loops are slower than vector math 
ratio = T_f / T_v;       % replace 1/2 with the ratio we want between T_v and T_f
fprintf('Execution time ratio: for loop / array operation = %f \n', ratio);
